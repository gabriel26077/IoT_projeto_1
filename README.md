# A simple corrosion indicator for electronic equipment

This is an amateur IoT project that aims to generate a corrosion indicator for electronic materials,
especially 3D printers. In this project, complex mathematical models were not used, but rather a basic
theoretical model that does not necessarily reflect the true level of corrosion. In short, it is just
a project for teaching purposes.
